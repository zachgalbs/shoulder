# Setting Up Your GitHub Repository - Quick Guide

Since you don't have an Apple Developer account, we'll distribute Shoulder as open-source code that users can download and run.

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `shoulder`
3. Description: "AI-powered focus tracking app for macOS using local LLMs"
4. Make it Public
5. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Update README with Your Username

Before pushing, update the README:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
# Do this in README.md, lines 29, 39, 59
```

Or you can find/replace all instances:
```bash
# On macOS/Linux:
sed -i '' 's/YOUR_USERNAME/your-actual-username/g' README.md

# Or manually edit README.md
```

## Step 3: Push Your Code to GitHub

```bash
# Add remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/shoulder.git

# Stage all files
git add .

# Create first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Shoulder focus tracking app

- FastAPI backend server with Ollama integration
- Local AI-powered activity analysis
- Installation and startup scripts
- Privacy-focused: all processing happens locally"

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages (Optional)

If you want a project website:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings"
3. Scroll to "Pages" in the left sidebar
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Select "main" branch and "/ (root)"
6. Click "Save"

Your site will be live at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/shoulder/`

## Step 5: Add Topics and Description

Make your repo more discoverable:

1. On your repo page, click the gear icon next to "About"
2. Add description: "AI-powered focus tracking app for macOS using local LLMs"
3. Add topics: `macos`, `productivity`, `ai`, `llm`, `ollama`, `focus-tracking`, `python`, `fastapi`
4. Add website (if you set up GitHub Pages)
5. Click "Save changes"

## Step 6: Create Your First Release (Optional)

While your app doesn't have a compiled binary, you can still create releases:

1. Go to your repo
2. Click "Releases" on the right
3. Click "Create a new release"
4. Tag version: `v1.0.0`
5. Release title: `Shoulder v1.0.0 - Initial Release`
6. Description:
   ```markdown
